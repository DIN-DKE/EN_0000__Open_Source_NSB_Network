  To:               All organisations

  Field of action:  Competence building and governance structures

  Recommendation:   Organisations should build up expertise in the field
                    of open source, enabling them to take informed action
                    and make informed decisions regarding open source.
                    Open source could, for example, be included in the
                    respective training curriculum. This applies to both
                    the private sector and administrations and public
                    authorities.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
