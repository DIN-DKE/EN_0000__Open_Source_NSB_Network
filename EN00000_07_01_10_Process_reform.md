  To:               Standardisation organisations

  Field of action:  procedural reform

  Recommendation:   European and national standardisation organisations
                    should establish appropriate interfaces or processes
                    for cooperation with open source foundations or
                    revise their processes to enable effective
                    cooperation. Possible forms of such cooperation could
                    include the agile further development of open source
                    standards or the publication of standards with open
                    source licences.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
