## Recommendations for action by the "Deutsches Strategieforum Normung"

Many standardisation organisations are analysing open source and the
necessary adjustments to standardisation work. DIN and DKE have launched
activities in this area, which are supported and accompanied in
particular by the FOCUS.digital strategy group. Other organisations have
introduced specific processes to incorporate open source developments
into their portfolios, such as ETSI with its Software Development Groups
(SDG). Similarly, the Linux Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation are
\"PAS Submitters\" to ISO/IEC JTC 1, i.e. they can submit specifications
to international standardisation according to a strictly ordered and
defined process, so that these become a \"Publicly Available
Specification\" (PAS) and are thus available within the framework of the
formally recognised canon of norms, standards and specifications.

In connection with new European regulations such as the AI Act, the
Cyber Resilience Act and the Data Act, which are closely based on the
processes of the New Legislative Framework (NLF), the question of
implementing European standards in open source software and the
involvement of and cooperation with open source communities in
standardisation has become even more pressing.

In order to take account of the importance of open source for innovation
and the competitiveness of Germany and Europe, including in the area of
standardisation, further action is needed at various levels. This
concerns seven key areas of action:

  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  **field of        **objectives**
  action**          

  competence        Systematically develop and expand the knowledge and
  building          skills necessary for open source within
                    organisations.

  governance        Systematically establish the foundations for good
  structures        governance for collaboration and use of open source
                    in organisations.

  innovation policy Incorporate open source more strongly into measures
                    that serve to promote innovation, and make greater
                    use of the potential of open source for innovation
                    and for promoting innovation.

  Market knowledge  Systematic compilation of reliable data on the
  and understanding significance of open source for the German and
                    European economy and on open source-based business
                    models.

  Participation in  Strengthening and promoting the participation of
  open source       German stakeholders in open source projects.
  projects          

  procedural        Revision of existing processes and, where necessary,
  reforms           introduction of new processes to create a
                    standardisation ecosystem that takes into account the
                    requirements of the IT sector in the area of open
                    source and in which the agility of developments is
                    strengthened.

  Cooperation       Implement measures to strengthen the interaction
  between           between standardisation and open source.
