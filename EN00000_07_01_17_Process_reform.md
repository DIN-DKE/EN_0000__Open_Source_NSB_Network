  Recommendation:   Open source foundations and communities should
                    identify the potential for standardisation and
                    normalisation within their technology portfolio and
                    establish or intensify contact with standardisation
                    and normalisation organisations in order to
                    incorporate technologies into standardisation and
                    normalisation.
