  Field of action:  Competence building and governance structures

  Recommendation:   The federal departments/authorities should include
                    the topic of open source in the context of
                    standardisation in the bilateral and multilateral
                    dialogues on standardisation that are conducted with
                    other countries, thereby strengthening understanding
                    of open source beyond the borders of Europe.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
