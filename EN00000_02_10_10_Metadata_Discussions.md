What data are necessary?
------------------------

The discussion in WS 2 led to the discussion, that most project relevant
metadata should be hosted on CEN/CENELEC’s existing infrastructure.

This led to the decision that only a minimal data set should be stored
on GitHub. The following table shows the data that must be available to
initiate a project:

package name mandatory Name of the software package.

project title mandatory Project title, can vary from package name.

version mandatory Current version.

author name mandatory Author of the package.

> (It must be check if CEN/CENELEC as an organisation can be the
> author.)

licence mandatory

copyright mandatory

created (at) mandatory (auto entry)

published (at) optional First commit. (Created by github)

description optional Scope

#### Discussion:

-   What additional data do the other workstreams need?

-   Legal Topic: GitHub expects an author of the software package.
    Usually this is an individual person, but can it be an organisation
    as CEN/CENELEC?

-   Governance Structures:

WS 2 proposes to host the data of the collaborators, users, etc. on
CEN/CENELEC systems and play them back to GitHub via the API.
