Naming Scheme
=============

***[Back to Start Page](EN00000_00_00_00_Start.md)***

To set up a new project on CEN/CENELC’s open source repository the following naming convention must be use.

Proposed scheme
---------------

```
<standard name>__<arbitrary_project_title>
```

- All spaces replaced by underscores
- Standard name and project title separated by two underscores  

E.g.:

```
EN_01234__Dummy_Project
```
