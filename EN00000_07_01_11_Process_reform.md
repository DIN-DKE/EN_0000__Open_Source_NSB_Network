  To:               Standardisation organisations

  Field of action:  procedural reform

  Recommendation:   European and national standardisation organisations
                    should establish orderly processes for incorporating
                    specifications/technologies from open source
                    foundations and communities into the body of
                    standards, e.g. in the form of a PAS procedure as
                    established by ISO/IEC JTC 1. However, such a
                    procedure must specify clear evaluation criteria, for
                    example based on Annex II of Regulation 1025/2012,
                    and is not intended to allow
                    specifications/technologies to be adopted directly as
                    harmonised standards.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
