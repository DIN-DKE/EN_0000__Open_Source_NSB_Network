  Responsible:      

                    

                    

  To:               Standardisation organisations

  Field of action:  procedural reform

  Recommendation:   ISO, IEC, CEN and CENELEC should create more
                    opportunities for direct participation, as limiting
                    participation to national delegations poses a number
                    of challenges, particularly with regard to the
                    availability of experts and the ability to contribute
                    expert knowledge directly to the standardisation
                    development process.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
