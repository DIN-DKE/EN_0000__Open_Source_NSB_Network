  To:               All organisations

  Field of action:  Competence building and governance structures

  Recommendation:   Organisations should establish the necessary
                    governance structures to shape the use of open source
                    within their organisations. This could take the form
                    of an Open Source Programme Office (OSPO), for
                    example, as numerous organisations have already
                    established. This applies to both the private sector
                    and administrations and public authorities.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
