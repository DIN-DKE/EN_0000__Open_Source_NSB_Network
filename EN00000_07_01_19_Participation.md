  Field of action:  participation

  Recommendation:   German industry should become more involved in the
                    development of open source technologies as well as in
                    standardisation. Open source technologies should be
                    given greater consideration and incorporated more
                    extensively into the standardisation process.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
