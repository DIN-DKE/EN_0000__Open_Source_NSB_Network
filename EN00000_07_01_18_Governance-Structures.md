  Field of action:  governance structures

  Recommendation:   Open source foundations and communities should
                    consider the issue of long-term maintenance of open
                    source software and establish appropriate processes
                    to ensure that software maintenance is coordinated.
                    Such processes should be standardised according to
                    uniform quality criteria and designed to be
                    transparent and traceable.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
