  Responsible:      

                    

                    

  To:               Standardisation organisations

  Field of action:  procedural reform

  Recommendation:   European and national standardisation organisations
                    should establish processes that create greater
                    transparency in the development of standards and
                    specifications, thereby making it easier for open
                    source communities to contribute comments and input
                    on the respective standards during the development
                    stage.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
