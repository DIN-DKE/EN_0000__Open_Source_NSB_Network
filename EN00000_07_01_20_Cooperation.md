  Recommendation:   Stakeholders in standardisation (especially experts)
                    should systematically evaluate the extent to which
                    open-source developments and implementations can
                    contribute to the creation of value and the
                    application of standards, and should seek to
                    establish links by contacting the relevant SDOs.
