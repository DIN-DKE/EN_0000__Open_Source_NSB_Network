  Field of action:  Competence building and governance structures

  Recommendation:   Federal departments/authorities should advocate in
                    Germany and Europe for better recognition of work
                    results that originate from open source. This could
                    include, in particular, public procurement and
                    corresponding criteria for the procurement of open
                    source.

  Time horizon:     04/25 - Start
